# Audit metadata v1

`audit.yml` is the canonical place to record audit target metadata, profile composition, concrete reviewer keys, actual tools/models, session identities, and structural orchestrator attestations. `findings.json.source` cites keys from `reviewers` such as `primary`, `peer`, or `verifier_peer_only`; roles remain descriptive metadata.

Keep this file local/private by default under `.audit/local/audits/<audit-id>/`. Legacy-only repositories may use `.claude/local/audits/<audit-id>/` while migrating.

The profile `source` is one of `direct`, `explicit-config-root`, `repo-neutral`, `repo-legacy`, or `default`. `local_override_source` is `neutral`, `legacy`, or `null`. Artifact `root_source` records `cli`, `profile`, `neutral-default`, or `legacy-fallback`. These provenance fields make path selection auditable without exposing override contents.

All helper-parsed YAML, including profiles, overrides, and `audit.yml`, rejects the reserved mapping keys `__proto__`, `prototype`, and `constructor` recursively; stage recording rejects the same names as reviewer keys before writing metadata. Startup requires the complete audit directory itself to be ignored, validates every planned standard artifact and unpredictable focused-verification candidates as defense in depth, and revalidates the target after writing the initial metadata and prompts.

`target.repos` is ordered exactly as the selected profile's `repos`; a single-repo audit contains one entry for the project root. `base_ref` and `head_ref` preserve the input strings while the OIDs pin resolved commits. PR/stack refs are mandatory and must resolve to different commits. The staged and unstaged hashes retain Git's review-oriented binary diff identity. The ordered `tracked` manifest separately binds each stage-0 index mode/OID and the raw worktree state, so clean/smudge filters, `assume-unchanged`, and `skip-worktree` cannot hide byte drift. Current `lstat` type determines `worktree_mode` independently of index mode/OID, so supported regular-file-to-symlink and symlink-to-regular transitions are captured using raw bytes or link text. Executable mode and explicit missing state are recorded. Parent symlinks, unsupported filesystem kinds, unmerged stages, and tracked gitlinks fail closed; audit a submodule as a separate selected repository. The ordered untracked manifest uses the same raw file/symlink treatment. Per-repo and aggregate hashes use recursively key-sorted, whitespace-free canonical JSON and exclude the derived per-repo `snapshot_sha256` field from identity.

Every generated primary, blind-peer, and final-diff prompt includes the ordered compact capture profile (`name`, nullable `role`, canonical `path`, `base_ref`, and `head_ref`) plus resolved OIDs, component digests/counts, per-repo digests, schema, and aggregate digest. A reviewer can replay those machine-readable records against the bound raw repositories to reproduce the displayed identities. Full tracked/untracked arrays remain in `audit.yml` rather than the prompt; omitting them keeps large-repository prompts bounded and does not disclose review artifacts to the blind peer.

Every completed reviewer run requires nonempty `tool`, `model`, and audit-unique `session_id`; every run also has a unique `dispatch_id`. Fixed and supplemental reviewer prompt and report paths are bound to their dispatched `audit.artifacts` entries, and reports are nonempty and hashed when recorded. No reviewer completion may predate `created_at`. Primary, peer, and final-diff stages cannot be redirected or overwritten, must run in timestamp order, and must have pairwise-distinct report hashes. Supplemental reviewers require valid completion timestamps no earlier than peer completion. Finalization must be no earlier than audit creation or any completed reviewer, and the finalizer independently rechecks these boundaries. The blind peer prompt contains no primary artifact or path and intentionally receives no repository-controlled profile fragments; an optional later critique must have a separate prompt, artifact, and dispatch ID.

`attestation.kind: orchestrator-attested` is written by `record-stage.mjs` and binds the audit, concrete reviewer key, dispatch, target snapshot, prompt digest, artifact, report digest, and record time. Every completed run has this structure even though the abbreviated example expands only the primary block. Supplemental verification runs must supply a nonempty confined `verification-<name>-prompt.md`; prompt-less reports cannot become finding sources.

After a focused verifier writes its report, record it with a unique, previously unused reviewer key:

```bash
node record-stage.mjs \
  --audit-yml .audit/local/audits/<audit-id>/audit.yml \
  --stage verification \
  --reviewer-key verifier-peer-only \
  --prompt verification-peer-only-prompt.md \
  --artifact verification-peer-only.md \
  --scope "peer-only findings" \
  --tool codex-agent \
  --model codex-example \
  --session-id verifier-session-id
```

Each terminal finding names at least two concrete completed reviewer keys and the exact recorded artifacts that contain its target-evidence review. Keep single-reviewer concerns outside terminal `findings.json`, for example in receipt open questions.

`record-stage.mjs` revalidates the target snapshot and fixed prompt digest, enforces stage order, nonempty run identity, distinct dispatch/session provenance, the dispatched fixed-stage artifact path, and nonempty distinct fixed-stage reports, then serializes an atomic `audit.yml` update. `finalize-audit.mjs --status <passed|passed_with_deferred|blocked>` revalidates all of these bindings plus valid `findings.json` and nonempty `receipt.md`. It validates the exhaustive finding status enum and concrete reviewer/artifact bindings for every retained finding. Unresolved findings require `blocked`; deferred findings forbid `passed`; `passed_with_deferred` requires a deferred finding. Finalization refuses an existing `finalization` block rather than overwriting it.

## Trust boundary

These are local structural checks over orchestrator-written metadata and artifact bytes. They are not signed or authenticated receipts and do not cryptographically prove authorship, execution-provider identity, reviewer independence, peer blindness, target inspection, or a model's internal cognition. Nonempty identities, distinct sessions, and unequal report hashes make mistakes and naive copying harder; the orchestrator and human remain responsible for launching the declared runs and limiting their inputs.
